# River-Water-Quality
Using this system, a person can detect pollutants from a water body from anywhere in the world. We can monitor the water quality parameters by using some sensors and these sensor parameters are sent to the IBM Watson cloud and stored in the data base. These parameters are visualized in the User Interface which is created using Node Red of IBM Watson platform. Whenever the water quality is not good, we can send notifications to authorities through the third-party services.
